I want to build a project spec-driven using https://github.com/github/spec-kit this tool.
read its guide and readme:
https://github.com/github/spec-kit/blob/main/README.md
also other resource, so you can help me with this request.

now I tell you all of the project, and give me the steps in details to use the spec-kit and get the best result.
The project is a “Watch-Together / Listen-Together + Whiteboard” real-time system.
It has authentication system (with jwt user password).
Users pre-registered. They login and join some rooms. Admin can create Room, and add some users using their username. A room is actually an isolated part that users can:
1. chat together real-time.
2. play a movie from list of files that pre-uploaded to server. control the playback together synced.
3. play songs that pre-uploaded to server. control the playback synced.
4. create playlists from existing songs for themselves or public (playlist type can be private or public)
5. draw on a shared canvas together. it is a shared whiteboard that users can draw everything and shown to others.
Backend is Go lang.
Frontend would be Vite with Reactjs (typescript) and tailwind. Frontend communicates with backend using api + jwt and websockets for real-time actions.
if it gets complicated for crowd rooms (rooms with more than 2 members). assume the project with rooms between just 2 users.
now give me the step by step usage of spec-kit commands including:
1. `/speckit.constitution`
2. `/speckit.specify`
3. `/speckit.plan`
4. `/speckit.tasks`
5. `/speckit.implement`
